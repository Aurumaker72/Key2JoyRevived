Simulate a GameController/Joystick using your keyboard and mouse.

This is a quick prototype so I could play the game ['Aperture Desk
Job'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/)
without the use of a Steam Deck or controller.

## Usage

**‚ö† Use at own risk!** Incorrect driver (un)installation may cause a
blue screen.

### Installation

1. *(Optional)* I advise you [create a System Restore
   Point](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-system-restore-point-77e02e2a-3298-c869-9974-ef5658ea3be9)
2. Download a binary from the [releases of this
   repo](https://github.com/luttje/KeyToJoy/releases)
3. Extract all files to the same location

### Starting

1. Start **![](KeyToJoy/Graphics/Icons/icon16.png?raw=true)
   KeyToJoy.exe**
2. *(First time only)* Accept installation of the Scp Virtual Bus Driver
3. Use the default bindings or modify them by double-clicking a row in
   the Control/Bind-list.

   ![Screenshot showing the key binding process. A controller has one
   highlighted button and a textbox shows the W button is currently
   bound to it.](.github/screenshot.png)

4. Tick the checkbox to simulate the game controller

KeyToJoy will now pretend that your keyboard input is Joystick input.

## Known Issues

- Windows wont let you click if you release a mouse key that hasn't been pressed before.

## Uninstalling

Use `ScpDriverInstaller.exe` to uninstall the driver. You can find the
latest version here: [mogzol/ScpDriverInterface
releases](https://github.com/mogzol/ScpDriverInterface/releases)

**‚ö† Do not uninstall the driver through Device manager or you'll end up
with an incomplete and corrupt driver installation.**

## Credits üòç

This exists only because of this awesome NuGet package
([DavidRieman/SimWinInput](https://github.com/DavidRieman/SimWinInput))
which allows simulation of gamepads from .NET.

Simulation is made possible through installation and usage of the
[nefarius/ScpVBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpVBus) driver. 

Inspired by [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/) which does the inverse
(simulate keyboard with gamepad).

This project uses slightly modified images of the [Controllers & Keyboard
Prompts by Nicolae (Xelu) Berbece](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/)
