# KeyToJoy
Simulate a GameController/Joystick using your keyboard and mouse.

This is an early version so I can play the game ['Aperture Desk Job'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/).

## üòç

This exists only because of this awesome NuGet package
([DavidRieman/SimWinInput](https://github.com/DavidRieman/SimWinInput)) which allows simulation of gamepads.
