# ![](KeyToJoy/Graphics/Icons/icon32.png?raw=true) KeyToJoy
Simulate a Joystick/Controller using your keyboard, mouse or other triggers.

In addition to simply simulating a button being pressed on the Joystick, you
can also write scripts with a more complex sequence of actions.

## Usage

**‚ö† Use at own risk!** Incorrect driver (un)installation may cause a blue
screen.

### Installation

1. *(Optional)* I advise you [create a System Restore
   Point](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-system-restore-point-77e02e2a-3298-c869-9974-ef5658ea3be9)
2. Download a binary from the [releases of this
   repo](https://github.com/luttje/KeyToJoy/releases)
3. Extract all files to the same location

### Starting

1. Start **![](KeyToJoy/Graphics/Icons/icon16.png?raw=true) KeyToJoy.exe**
2. *(First time only)* Accept installation of the Scp Virtual Bus Driver
3. Use the default bindings or modify them by double-clicking a row in the
   Control/Bind-list.

   > üöß TODO: This information is outdated. The software has a lot more
   > capabilities.

   ![Screenshot showing the key binding process. A controller has one
   highlighted button and a textbox shows the W button is currently bound to
   it.](.github/screenshot.png)

4. Tick the checkbox to simulate the game controller

KeyToJoy will now pretend that your keyboard input is Joystick input.

## Scripting

You can create scripts in Lua or Javascript that perform a sequence of
actions with more complex logic.

Here is a simple example of a script that presses the "A" button on a
gamepad and then stops simulating input after two seconds:
```lua
Print("Hello World!")

GamePad.Simulate(GamePadControl.A, PressState.PressAndRelease)
SetTimeout(function()
   App.Command("abort")
end, 2000)
```

**You probably want to bind scripts only to the "Release" press state of
triggers.** Otherwise a script will be executed both on key down AND up.

Full scripting reference is available in
[Docs/Scripting.md](Docs/Scripting.md)

## Known Issues

- Windows wont let you click if you release a mouse key that hasn't been
  pressed before.

---

## Uninstalling

Use `ScpDriverInstaller.exe` to uninstall the driver. You can find the
latest version here: [mogzol/ScpDriverInterface
releases](https://github.com/mogzol/ScpDriverInterface/releases)

**‚ö† Do not uninstall the driver through Device manager or you'll end up with
an incomplete and corrupt driver installation.**

## Credits üòç

This exists only because of this awesome NuGet package
([DavidRieman/SimWinInput](https://github.com/DavidRieman/SimWinInput))
which allows simulation of gamepads from .NET.

Simulation is made possible through installation and usage of the
[nefarius/ScpVBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpVBus) driver. 

Inspired by [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/) which does the inverse
(simulate keyboard with gamepad).

This project uses slightly modified images of the [Controllers & Keyboard
Prompts by Nicolae (Xelu) Berbece](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/)
